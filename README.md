# Candy Crush Game
A simple recreation of the popular mobile game, Candy Crush, recreated with unity assets and C# where the player tries to match three or more of the same candy to erase them off the board. The goal for this recreation is just to try and get the high score. 

## Installation:
This game is for unity version 5.3.1, so to run it, open the project in that version and hit play.

## What I did for this game:
For this game, I helped set up the board space that the candy appears in, as well as setting up the method to generate a new random board for each game. I also implemented the mechanic to erase the candy once they were matched, and for new candy to fall in from the top of the screen, and for the player to be able to swap the positions of two candies (the candy selected is indicated by a box).
